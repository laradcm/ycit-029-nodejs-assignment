# Details about this YCIT029 assignment 

1. I installed and used joi for data validation, without joi this server will not function, to install it you can use:

```cmd
    npm i joi
```
Alternatively you can install all npm packages from my package.JSON (which will include joi):

```cmd
    npm i 
```
2. The data input format is 

```json
    {
        "name": "username",
        "age" : 35
    }
```
The server attaches the id to the new user automatically, the server will not allow an id to be attached to the json body input

3.  The port chosen for local testing is: `3000`, alternatively you may set a preferred PORT using the process.env.PORT variable, this can be done, 

using cmd:
```cmd
set PORT=3333
```

using powershell:
```powershell
$env:PORT=3333
```

using bash/zsh:
```bash
export PORT=3333
```
5. The id is being generated by randomly picking a number ranging from `1-1000` as long as it has not already been used. Normally this would be generated using uuid, though for the sake of the assignment setup and testing it was kept as integers.

6. Due to the increased complexity of generating random unique numbers with a higher number of users, this server is limited to a maximum of `15` users.

7. I used the imsomnia client to test this server and have added my insomnia.json export to this github page for easy testing, upon importing the testing methods can be found on the `DEBUG` section. You can download imsomnia for free at: https://insomnia.rest/download
